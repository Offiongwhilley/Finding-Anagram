# Finding-Anagram
This repo contains the solution to my Zuri task on Finding Anagrams

The task:

Open “main.py”, and complete the function “find_anagrams”. It should accept two strings, and determine if they are anagrams. You can read more about anagrams here.

Your function should return True  if they are anagrams, else  False.
